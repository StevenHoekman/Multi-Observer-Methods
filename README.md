# Multi-Observer-Methods
Multi-Observer Methods for Estimating Uncertain Species Identification

## Summary
Release version 1.2.3 of this repository archives data and novel R computer code presented in the companion article: 
  - Hoekman, Steven T. 2021. Multi-observer methods for estimating uncertain species identification. Ecosphere 12(9):e03648. http://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3648
 
The article presents statistical models for multi-observer methods that allow estimation of uncertain species identification (species misidentification and partial identification, which is identification to the lowest certain taxon) during population ecology surveys that involve enumerating individuals. Independent Data Supplements (described below) contain necessary R computer code, files, and documentation. Release version 1.2.3 of the repository is updated for increased computational efficiency and is compatible with the [R Statistical Computing Environment]( https://www.r-project.org/) version 4.1. I recommend the latest release for most users.
## Data supplements
Files for each of four data supplements are provided in separate subdirectories. In addition to instructions for usage, documentation in metadata files lists required and optional R packages. 
  - DataS1: Example R Code
  - DataS2: Input Files for Simulations
  - DataS3: R Code for Simulations
  - DataS4: Analyses of Murrelet Surveys

DataS1 provides simple examples of multi-observer method models, with R code, example input, and example output. 
DataS2 and DataS3 provide input files and R code to replicate simulation study described in the companion article or to conduct user-specified simulations. 
DataS4 provides data and R code used to conduct statistical analyses of multi-observer method models applied to line transect surveys for Kittlitz’s and marbled murrelets in Glacier Bay, Alaska, USA.
